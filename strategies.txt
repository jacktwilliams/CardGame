The strategy that players use for bidding goes as follows:
	Add one bid for a Joker. 
	Add one bid for any Jack.
	Add another bid if there are two complimentary jacks and set the trump choice as one of the jacks. 
	Then, if there were complimentary jacks, then add a bid for an Ace that matches either of those suits. Update the trump choice as the Ace suit.
	Also, if there were complimentary jacks, then add a bid for a King that matches the trump suit chosen. 

	The strategy is fairly conservative. Bids for Aces and Kings are only added if there is already a decent hand. As of now, Aces will check both of the Jack suits and
	chose the trump accordingly, but Kings will only add a bid if there is a King that matches the already determined suit.
	
The strategy that is used for playing or passing:
	Play if there is a joker.
	Otherwise add one trick for any trump suit jack, complimentary jack, trump Ace, or trump King. 
	If the number of expected tricks is greater than one, then play.
	This is a conservative strategy that makes sure there is one cushion trick to avoid going negative. 
	
A player might bid one, win, and consequently pick the trump. Then, because of the passing strategy, the player will occasionally pass, even after picking trump.
